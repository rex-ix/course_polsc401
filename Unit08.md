**Unit 8: Ethical Dilemmas in Governance: Foreign Relations, Foreign
Trade, Foreign Aid, and Military Intervention** <span id="8"></span> 
*In this unit, you will examine ethical issues that arise in foreign
policy.  What is America’s ethical role in the world?  Should we be the
world’s policeman?  Do we have a duty to act multilaterally, or should
we act unilaterally, and if so, under what circumstances?  What is
America’s duty to care for the poor, sick, or infirm outside of our
borders?  What legal and ethical constraints should be placed on
international trade?  How do we balance moral obligations with national
security realities and global financial realities?*  
  
 *Each of these dilemmas may be examined under the five frameworks
discussed in Unit 2, sometimes resulting in different outcomes.  You
will see which frameworks lawmakers, judges, and officials tend to apply
to different types of issues and circumstances.  Understanding how these
dilemmas are approached and resolved in practice is important for
students of political science and public policy; it is also essential
knowledge for those planning to enter the legal, public service, or
lobbying professions.*

**Unit 8 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take you approximately 11 hours to complete.
