**Unit 1: The Role of Ethics and Morality in Politics** <span
id="1"></span> 
*In this unit, you will begin your study of ethics in politics and
governance.  Ethics are rules that guide the decision-making process.
 They are rooted in religion, morality, law, education, experience, and
human strengths and weaknesses.  You will examine several definitions of
“ethics” and learn how the “ethics” of our leaders have evolved over
time.  For instance, the Founding Fathers of the United States are often
portrayed as highly moral men—yet, most of them were slave owners.  What
may have been considered ethical in previous decades is no longer
considered ethical due to evolving cultural norms and societal mores.*  
 *        
 In the United States, federal and state government employees are
subjected to formal ethical codes that seek to avoid or mitigate damage
to the public caused by political activities, lobbying, conflicts of
interest, bribery, graft, spoils, and nepotism.  Both the executive and
legislative branches of government have agencies or officials charged
with investigating allegations of breaches of ethical codes by employees
or other officials.  Punishment for such violations is often tinged with
political overtones.  Officials may be censured or impeached.  Employees
may receive disciplinary action ranging from counseling to
termination.*  
 *             
 Ethics in international affairs are quite complicated.  The stated
desire by a leader to “do the right thing” may be trumped by national
security concerns or lack of resources.  As with many things in today’s
world, economic and social injustice abroad can impact our national
security—one needs only to look to Afghanistan and the role its
disintegration into a failed state played in the events of 9/11 to see
this.*
