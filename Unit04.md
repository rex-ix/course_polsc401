**Unit 4: Ethical Dilemmas in Governance: Income Taxation, EEO
Compliance, and Affirmative Action** <span id="4"></span> 
*In this unit, you will examine three controversial areas of public
policy in which the government intentionally treats groups of people
differently in order to promote the common good.  Since 1916, the
federal government has taxed the income of citizens, residents, and
anyone present in the United States or its sovereign territories.  Most
states and a few cities also impose income taxes.  There are many
critiques of the income tax system, claiming that it is grossly unfair. 
The basis for the claim of injustice depends, of course, on the group
being examined.*  
  
 *Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) laws, such as the Civil Rights Act
of 1964, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the Age Discrimination
in Employment Act all seek to ensure that barriers to employment and
advancement are not based on race, national origin, disability, gender,
religion, age, or family status.  If such policies are not economically
neutral, how do we assess claims of fairness against claims of economic
efficiency?*  
  
 *Affirmative action programs have been criticized by some for giving
preferential treatment to certain groups, often to the perceived
detriment of others.  The intent behind the program is to remedy past
systemic discriminatory practices.  While there have been some noted
abuses and injustices in the system, much of the public uproar is due to
a misunderstanding of the application of the policy and “urban myths”
about affirmative action.*  
  
 *What is the ethical justification for treating individuals
“differently” in certain circumstances? What gives government the right
to tell businesses how to operate, particularly in the selection,
hiring, and discipline of employees? Each of these dilemmas may be
examined under the five frameworks discussed in Unit 2, sometimes
resulting in different outcomes.  You will see which frameworks
lawmakers, judges, and officials tend to apply to different types of
issues and circumstances.  Understanding how these dilemmas are
approached and resolved in practice is important for students of
political science and public policy; it is also essential knowledge for
those planning to enter the legal, public service, or lobbying
professions.*
