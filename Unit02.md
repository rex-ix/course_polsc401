**Unit 2: Theoretical Frameworks for Analyses of Ethical Dilemmas**
<span id="2"></span> 
*In this unit, you will examine both classical and contemporary theories
of ethics, as well as frameworks that can be used by decision makers to
resolve ethical dilemmas. The five primary frameworks are the Common
Good, Fairness or Justice, Utilitarian, Rights, and Virtue approaches.
 Each framework seeks to identify problems, gather facts, and assess
solutions, but the method for assessing the viability of available
solutions differs between the different frameworks.*  
 *             
 While a policymaker may have a preferred approach to many problems, one
approach may not be appropriate or feasible for all types of dilemmas
political leaders may face.  Knowledge of a variety of approaches and
how each can be applied to a given situation is necessary.*

**Unit 2 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take you approximately 21 hours to complete.
