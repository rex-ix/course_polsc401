**Unit 10: Ethical Dilemmas in Governance: Daily Operations of
Government, Lobbying, Campaigns and Elections** <span id="10"></span> 
*In this final unit, you will examine common ethical dilemmas faced by
public servants and officials in their daily work, as well as issues
specific to campaigns and elections.  What restrictions should be placed
on acceptance of gifts and favors?  What duties and responsibilities do
public servants and officials owe to citizens?  How are ethical issues
investigated?  How are ethical regulations enforced?  What restrictions
should be placed on donations to political campaigns or efforts to lobby
policymakers?*  
  
 *Each of these dilemmas may be examined under the five frameworks
discussed in Unit 2, sometimes resulting in different outcomes.  You
will see which frameworks lawmakers, judges, and officials tend to apply
to different types of issues and circumstances.  Understanding how these
dilemmas are approached and resolved in practice is important for
students of political science and public policy; it is also essential
knowledge for those planning to enter the legal, public service, or
lobbying professions.*

**Unit 10 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take you approximately 11 hours to complete.
