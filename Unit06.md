**Unit 6: Ethical Dilemmas in Governance: Issues Involving Families and
Relationships** <span id="6"></span> 
*Marital, personal, and family relationships are an area in which
policymakers and officials often have to make difficult ethical and
legal decisions.  Should consenting adults be allowed to engage in
sexual or marital relationships with whoever they choose?  What are the
limits that the government can/should place on such relationships?
 Whose interests are paramount in family relationships—those of the
child or those of the parents and grandparents?  What limits should the
government place on procreation, contraception, and abortion?*  
  
 *Each of these dilemmas may be examined under the five frameworks
discussed in Unit 2, sometimes resulting in different outcomes.  You
will see which frameworks lawmakers, judges, and officials tend to apply
to different types of issues and circumstances.  Understanding how these
dilemmas are approached and resolved in practice is important for
students of political science and public policy; it is also essential
knowledge for those planning to enter the legal, public service, or
lobbying professions.*
