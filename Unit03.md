**Unit 3: Ethical Dilemmas in Governance: Individual Liberty, Public
Safety, and Justice** <span id="3"></span> 
*In this unit, you will examine a few of the different types of ethical
dilemmas that policymakers face in the areas of individual liberties,
public safety, and criminal justice.  This unit will focus on the rights
based on the United States Constitution, such as the protection of
speech and political acts under the First Amendment, the right to bear
arms under the Second Amendment, punishment of felons, and issues
involving drugs and illegal immigration.  This unit will examine
questions like: How do individual rights need to be balanced with the
security needs of the state? Where do the rights of individuals end and
the rights of society as a whole begin?*  
  
 *Each of these dilemmas may be examined under the five frameworks
discussed in Unit 2, sometimes resulting in different outcomes.  You
will see which frameworks lawmakers, judges, and officials tend to apply
to different types of issues and circumstances.  Understanding how these
dilemmas are approached and resolved in practice is important for
students of political science and public policy; it is also essential
knowledge for those planning to enter the legal, public service, or
lobbying professions.*

**Unit 3 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take you approximately 16.75 hours to complete.
