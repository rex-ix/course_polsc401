**Unit 7: Ethical Dilemmas in Governance: National Security** <span
id="7"></span> 
*In this unit, you will begin by examining issues of law and ethics that
arise in conventional conflicts, such as wars, then you will look at
issues of law and ethics that arise in nonconventional conflicts, such
as espionage and terrorism, and you will conclude by exploring issues
regarding composition of military forces.  What are the justifications
for war?  What limits, if any, should be placed on war?  How should we
treat “the enemy?”  Should women be allowed to serve in the military? 
Should there be limits on the roles that women play in combat?  Should
sexual preference play any role in military recruitment or retention?*  
  
 *Each of these dilemmas may be examined under the five frameworks
discussed in Unit 2, sometimes resulting in different outcomes.  You
will see which frameworks lawmakers, judges, and officials tend to apply
to different types of issues and circumstances.  Understanding how these
dilemmas are approached and resolved in practice is important for
students of political science and public policy; it is also essential
knowledge for those planning to enter the legal, public service, or
lobbying professions.*
