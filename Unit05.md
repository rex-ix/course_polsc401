**Unit 5: Ethical Dilemmas in Governance: Care for the Poor, Sick,
Elderly, and Infirm** <span id="5"></span> 
*Since ancient times, one of the recognized purposes of government has
been to bind communities together and help care for one another. In this
unit, you will examine government policies that seek to provide benefits
for the poor, sick, elderly, and infirm. How do lawmakers and officials
justify “taking” from some in the form of taxes in order to “give” to
others in need of assistance?  What are the ethical and legal
limitations on such programs?  These questions form the basis for
inquiry in this unit.*  
  
 *Social welfare dilemmas may be examined under the five frameworks
discussed in Unit 2, sometimes resulting in different outcomes. You will
see which frameworks lawmakers, judges, and officials tend to apply to
different types of issues and circumstances. Understanding how these
dilemmas are approached and resolved in practice is important for
students of political science and public policy; it is also essential
knowledge for those planning to enter the legal, public service, or
lobbying professions.*

**Unit 5 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take you approximately 11.25 hours to complete.
