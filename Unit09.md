**Unit 9: Ethical Dilemmas in Governance: Science, Technology, and
Commerce** <span id="9"></span> 
*In this unit, you will examine the role that ethics play in the
policymaking process for laws and regulations involving science,
technology, and commerce.  Should the government engage in corporate
“social welfare,” or should we allow the free market to choose
commercial “winners” and “losers?”  What types of commercial regulations
should the government impose without burdening the free flow of goods
and services in our economy?  What limits should be placed on medical
research or cloning of foodstuffs?  How do we balance individual bodily
autonomy with the need to protect the public by restricting the spread
of infection and disease?  How should individual privacy rights online
be balanced against security and public safety concerns?*  
  
 *Each of these dilemmas may be examined under the five frameworks
discussed in Unit 2, sometimes resulting in different outcomes.  You
will see which frameworks lawmakers, judges, and officials tend to apply
to different types of issues and circumstances.  Understanding how these
dilemmas are approached and resolved in practice is important for you to
know as a student of political science and public policy; it is also
essential knowledge for those planning to enter the legal, public
service, or lobbying professions.*

**Unit 9 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take you approximately 16.25 hours to complete.
